- ✅ **Add Products**: Complete form with all required fields
- ✅ **Edit Products**: In-place editing with validation
- ✅ **Delete Products**: Soft delete functionality
- ✅ **View Products**: Role-based product visibility
- ✅ **Bulk Upload**: Excel file upload support

### 2. **User Interface**

### 3. **API Endpoints**
- ✅ `POST /api/products` - Create new product
- ✅ `PUT /api/products/{id}` - Update product
- ✅ `DELETE /api/products/{id}` - Delete product
- ✅ `GET /api/products` - Get manufacturer's products
- ✅ `GET /api/products/categories` - Get categories

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Backend API (`server/app/api/v1/products.py`)

#### Product Creation
```python
@products_bp.route('/', methods=['POST'])
@jwt_required()
@roles_required(['manufacturer', 'distributor'])
def create_product():
    """Create new product (manufacturers and distributors)"""
    # Validates required fields: name, sku
    # Sets manufacturer_id to current user
    # Handles category assignment
    # Supports image URL and base price
```

#### Product Updates
```python
@products_bp.route('/<product_id>', methods=['PUT'])
@jwt_required()
@roles_required(['manufacturer', 'distributor'])
def update_product(product_id):
    """Update product (manufacturers and distributors)"""
    # Validates product ownership
    # Updates all fields including name, description, price
    # Maintains data integrity
```

#### Role-Based Product Filtering
```python
if user.role == 'manufacturer':
    # Manufacturers see only their own products
    query = Product.query.filter_by(
        manufacturer_id=current_user_id,
        is_active=True
    )
```

### Frontend Implementation (`client/src/pages/products.tsx`)

#### Add Product Dialog
```tsx
{userRole === 'manufacturer' && (
  <div className="flex gap-3 mt-4 sm:mt-0">
    <Button onClick={() => setIsAddDialogOpen(true)}>
      <Plus className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
      Add Product
    </Button>
    <Button variant="outline" onClick={() => bulkUploadRef.current?.click()}>
      <Upload className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
      Bulk Upload
    </Button>
  </div>
)}
```

#### Product Form Fields
- **Product Name** (required)
- **SKU** (required, unique)
- **Category** (dropdown selection)
- **Brand** (optional)
- **Unit** (pieces, kg, m, l)
- **Description** (textarea)
- **Base Price** (required, numeric)
- **Stock Quantity** (optional)
- **Image URL** (optional)

### Product Grid Component (`client/src/components/products/product-grid.tsx`)

#### Manufacturer Action Buttons
```tsx
case 'manufacturer':
  return (
    <Button 
      variant="outline" 
      size="sm"
      onClick={() => handleEditProduct(product)}
      data-testid={`button-edit-product-${product.id}`}
      className="w-full"
    >
      <Edit className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
      Edit Product
    </Button>
  );
```
